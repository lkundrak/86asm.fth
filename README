86ASM.FTH - Simple FORTH assembler for Intel 8086
=================================================

The 86ASM.FTH is a FORTH package providing an assembler for the Intel 8086
processor. It provides words corresponding to the human readable mnemonics
of the instructions and operands that append corresponding machine code to
the dictionary.

It has been tested with GForth and Open Firmware. It aims to be as simple
as possible and uses no fancy features, hopefully being portable to very
limited FORTH implementations.

Note that this is the first release of 86ASM.FTH. As of this moment, it has
seen little practical use and its actual utility could be limited.
